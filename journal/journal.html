          i do two reps of 100, 50 and 25 of depending on the arm action<br>

          i watch the real housewives of atlanta while i work out<br>
          and i walk strangely all over the apartment<br>
          a couple months ago i started crying when i was doing crunches<br>

          [DRAFT pg1] <br> 
           Here i am im reading to the computer outloud a story and hoping that it gets it all down right
           it’s beautiful story it’s very thoughtful and smart and i feel very smart sitting here in the evening 
           reading to the computer. Its not a fancy computer but i was able to find a free website where you 
           talk at it and it writes down everything you say or read to it. So i guess im reading a story to a 
           website. I alone am adding this story into the AI cloud machine thingy and hoping it likes it. 
           The neighbors upstairs sound like they are throwing a couch back and forth and i know they are eating 
           pizza because i can smell it. I hope that the website doesn't think the loud bangs are part of the story 
           because the story doesn't have that sort of drama in it. At least not in this part. In this part it is 
           just a nice little story that is taking its time to get started to really get into the smart stuff and 
           the stuff that is heartwarming and scary and really makes you think about you know everything. 
           That part hasn't come yet. This is the part i am on now. It's about a computer that is in love with a 
           glass of water and their love is wrong and can never be because if it was the water glass would be empty
           and the computer would be electrocuted. Its the greatest love story of our time and most everyone in 
           the population reads it all the time. Because everyone can relate to being the glass the water and the 
           computer. <br><br>

           Its a story about agony and distance and most everything in life. People love and hate the story but mostly
           they all read it because it is required reading material by the government. There are some major plot holes
           that are interpreted to mean different stuff in the story they have caused great divides in families in 
           virtual classrooms and amongst coworkers who are normally in agreeance with each other on most other topics 
           even on whether or not they are the glass or the water or the computer. <br><br>   

           Im telling the website the story so that i can publish it independently and tell the way i feel about it. 
           So that more people can understand that I through a lot of research am the foremost authority on the subject
           because i am a very highly awarded and respected journalist and a glass of water. <br><br>
